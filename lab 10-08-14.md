##•	Repositories
o	When you uninstall things, you have to use a smart program to determine which parts are still being used and which aren’t  
o	DLL: library of shared folders/components of an application  
o	Every program for Windows, Mac installs hundreds of DLLs   
o	Versioning becomes a problem – difficult to keep track of shared components; Windows just gave up on it, added DLLs each time, have to use a program when uninstalling b/c of this   
o	In Linux/Unix world, all the programs/files available for the OS are checked into the global repository – so you will call up for Firefox (for example) and get it from the repository rather than getting it online. All the conflicts are taken care of on the repository level rather than the computer level  
o	For Mac, unofficial central repository is Brew   
o	Other types of repositories connected to languages   
o	Have to install repository managers to access them (not automatically on the machine)   
o	In sum, installing something outside the system is destabilizing and potentially dangerous, this is a good alternative  
##•	Search tools
o	Locate – to find files (make sure directory is updated)  
o	Find  
o	Grep  
o	Awk   
##•	Network 
o	Wget – get something off the internet   
o	Curl   
o	Ssh   
o	Ping  
o	Traceroute  
##•	Friends
o	Head – show beginning of file  
o	Tail – show end of file   
o	Cat  
o	Man  
•	Flow   
o	| >>  
o	Xargs   
##•	Commands (Windows)
o	 Cygwin – can use wget command – find a pdf, type wget [paste link here] to add file to directory from the internet   
o	Head – give a little peek into file (same with Tale)  
o	Take naming files seriously – if it’s a pdf end with .pdf  
o	Reminder: pandoc –o: guess the file based on the extension  
o	* means anything (globbing)   
	Rm –ri test*  
	Means: remove recursively with confirmation anything that starts with test  
•	Recursively – goes into the directory, removes from there, then comes back up and remove itself
