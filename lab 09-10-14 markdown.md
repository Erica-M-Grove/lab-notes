Why/what is the terminal?

•	Screen and keyboard – how we interact with the machine  
•	One machine serving many people  
•	Move away from this type of computing, but now moving back through the cloud  
•	Terminal emulator: emulates the terminal entrance to the machine (unix)  
•	Inside of the terminal emulator is bash  
•	Way of interacting with your machine that will be around for the rest of your life  
•	Will you be able to access your files years down the line?  
•	Is the source code free? Does it allow you to modify?  
•	Not the notion of code, but the notion of text that drives the philosophy – has to be human friendly  
•	Microsoft word, photoshop, indesign, illustrator all have different ways of interfacing   
o	Is it going to grow with you/your knowledge and expertise?   
o	Invest your time in tools that will grow with you  
•	In terminal window everything works the same in every machine   
##Commands:   
•	pwd – tells you where you are – the root of it (orientation command)

•	ls – list files/folders in your directory (also orientation command)

•	man ls – manual page for ls 

•	man man – manual page for man

•	q – quit manual 

•	cd – change directory

•	cd .. – change back to previous directory

•	babun creates its own directory, so there’s no way you can get to your windows through Cygwin/babun terminal: just creates a send box

•	you may want to transfer all your docs to your Cygwin subfolder if you’re going to continue using it 

•	clear


•	cd ~ - home 

•	bin contains the core toolkit 

•	syntax: transitive verb – adv – object 

•	ls (list contents of the current directory) 

•	ls /bin/ - list contents of root bin – gets to core toolkit 

•	tab autocompletes – autocomplete protects you from doing stupid things (making typos)  - autocomplete almost everything
•	mkdir – make directory
•	cat – change your standard output 


##Plaintext

•	plaintext is small, baked into the os, has been around for a long time and will continue to be around

o	pdfs, word files are not plaintext 
	underneath there is not something readable by humans – pdf needs adobe to read it
o	when your files are in plaintext, they can easily be processed/reprocessed/mined for information
