#Lab 10-01-14 Terminal skills
•	Touch test.txt   
•	Echo “words” – echoes what’s in quotes on the screen  
•	History: all the commands you’ve done today  
•	History | grep “hello” (or other word): searches history for all instances of that   
•	| means piping  
•	Posix:  
o	Verb adverb noun(noun is always a path)  
o	rm –ri temp/  
o	“command” “flag” “target”  
o	*best practice when naming files: no spaces, no capitals, use –i (means “ask for confirmation” – are you sure?)  
##•	Warnings:
o	When you use cp (copy) be careful because it can override– use –i   
o	Cp target1.txt target2.txt OR better w/dangerous commands cp –i target1.txt target2.txt  
o	Move file – mv – also dangerous, also overrides   
o	Mv –i ../target-three.txt target2.txt (moves one directory up (what you see in the above directory), moves and renames file)  
o	Remove – rm  
	Safer option: mkdir trash/   
	Mv target2.txt trash/  
	Just move into trash directory  
o	VERY DANGEROUS: Remove directory rm –ri directory/  
o	wget ctrl shift v: grab files off the internet (more next week)
