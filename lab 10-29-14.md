#Code and Poetry Lab 10-29-14: Turing Machine
##•	Negation machine
o	M1: A -> !A  
•	Circular vs. noncircular machines: if you want it to stop you need to program it to do so
##•	Affirmation machine
o	M2: A -> A (leaves it alone)
##•	Universal Turing machine:
o	Mu: can take as an input a whole machine (takes the circuit and drops it in)  
o	Can take on the property of any other Turing machine  
o	What is hardware and software here?   
•	What’s effectively computable is computable for Turing  
•	“We may compare a man in the process of computing a real number to a machine which is only capable of a finite number of conditions…m-configurations…’directly aware’…behavior of the machine ” (231).  
o	Machine that is aware: influential in artificial intelligence  
o	Whatever is the current symbol is part of its m-state   
•	232: “If at each stage the motion of a machine…is completely determined by the configuration, we shall call the machine an ‘automatic machine’”.  
•	Self-rewriting machine: machine that can reconfigure its internal states  
•	250: “the behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his ‘state of mind’ at that moment.”  
•	How does the author define the state of the machine?  
o	State of mind ¬+ internal state  
•	What is software here?   
o	Not easy to get at this. The internal state is a physical (hardware) thing here. The symbol seems to be abstractable, so softwareish.   
•	What’s the difference between data and program?  
o	Whatever data is physically in front of you is a part of the physical configuration/state   
•	Just a little thing in your BIOS that comes to life: boot process takes a little and manages to start up from there  
•	Emulator: take your Nintendo, emulate the processes on your laptop   
•	Turing machine can read and write symbols.  
o	Discreteness of the states is important: not a continuum  
o	Symbol-manipulation machine (doesn’t manipulate fields or anything else), but if you can reduce a field and the operation of a tractor to a set of symbols then you can emulate it.
